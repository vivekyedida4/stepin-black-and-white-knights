# INTRODUCTION
In this project they have given a Sudoku puzzle to solve.Basically Sudoku is a 9x9 matrix .The main ruleof Sudoku is we have to fill the numbers in such a way that no number should be repeated in row and column.It also consists of 9 3x3 matrices. In them  all the numbers should be filled from 1 to 9.
               Here in our project,we assigned value 0 to empty places .First we printed the grid using printgrid function.Later we checked the empty grids using empty grid function.We used a logic such that assigning a specific value if grid has zero value.If the grid do not contain zero value then it remains same.Later we called isvalid function to check whether  the selected number is correct or not.If the number is not correct it shows error
